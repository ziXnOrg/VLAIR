- Determinism & Reproducibility:
  - LLM calls: temperature=0, top_p=1.0, fixed seeds; record model/version
  - Use idempotency keys for agent tasks; no hidden side effects

- CI gates (must pass):
  - Lint, build, unit/integration/property tests
  - Coverage >= 85% overall; include failure-path coverage
  - Attach artifacts: coverage, logs, bench outputs, seeds/models

- Budgets:
  - Token and runtime budgets set per workflow; fail fast on overruns
