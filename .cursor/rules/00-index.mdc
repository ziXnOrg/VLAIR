- Read these first:
  - Docs/Blueprint.md
  - Docs/production-agentic-workflow.md

- Non-negotiables (project-level):
  - Determinism and reproducibility (temperature=0, fixed seeds, idempotency keys)
  - Correctness-first (tests drive implementation; failure paths covered)
  - Performance targets appropriate to agents/context (document SLOs in PRs)
  - Interface stability (versioned task/result schemas; backward-compatible changes)
  - Security-conscious tool use; explicit error handling; no silent failures

- Note: Crash-safety is optional; apply when persistence semantics are in-scope.
