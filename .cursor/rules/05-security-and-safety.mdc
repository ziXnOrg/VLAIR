- Tooling & Execution:
  - Structured tool/function calls only; no ad-hoc shell
  - Sandbox execution; minimal privileges; time/memory limits
  - No destructive operations without explicit approval and display of diff/impact

- Output Hygiene:
  - Sanitize/redact secrets; avoid leaking tokens/paths unintentionally
