Context/Goal: Windows CI timeout test still returns INTERNAL_ERROR after rc=124 forcing. Apply minimal deterministic fix: tolerance + ensure kill on duration fallback (Issue #5); validate via CI.
Actions:
- Parsed Windows job logs for run 18822143041: pytest failure at tests/unit/sandbox_v2_test.py::test_integration_timeout_enforced; coverage 86.41% (>=85%).
- Adjusted fallback threshold in exec/sandbox.py: treat as timeout if duration_ms >= int(wall_time_s*1000) - 50 (50 ms tolerance for Windows jitter).
- Ensured process termination when fallback triggers (p.kill() under suppress) to avoid stray processes.
Results:
- Prior run summary: 1 failed, 80 passed, 5 skipped, 20 warnings in ~4.93s. Coverage OK (86.41%).
Diagnostics:
- Failure message: expected TIMEOUT/124 but got INTERNAL_ERROR (indicates timed_out=False path still taken on Windows GHA).
- Likely precision/jitter on duration threshold causing fallback not to trigger despite over-limit workload.
Decision(s): Adopt small tolerance and kill-on-fallback; keep platform-agnostic code path; no dependency changes.
Follow-ups:
- Commit/push to debug/ci-windows-timeout-diagnostics; monitor Windows job; extract diagnostics JSON (timed_out=true, status="TIMEOUT", rc_mapped=124, reason="wall timeout", duration_ms≈1000–1200) and post to Issue #5.

Area: CI|Runtime
Context/Goal: Strengthen Windows timeout mapping to force rc=124 whenever timeout is detected by duration fallback (Issue #5); re-run CI to validate.
Actions:
- Updated exec/sandbox.py to compute rc_raw = 124 if timed_out else (p.returncode if p.returncode is not None else 1).
- Intention: eliminate ambiguity where Windows sets a non-zero exit code post-limit even when timed_out=True via duration.
Results:
- CI run pending at the time of this entry; prior run failed on Windows with INTERNAL_ERROR despite duration fallback.
Diagnostics:
- Hypothesis: previous logic used p.returncode when present, causing normalization to INTERNAL_ERROR on Windows.
Decision(s): Force rc=124 when timed_out=True to guarantee TIMEOUT mapping.
Follow-ups:
- Monitor Windows CI; extract diagnostics JSONL showing timed_out=true, status="TIMEOUT", rc_mapped=124, reason="wall timeout", duration_ms≈1000–1200; post to Issue #5.

Area: CI|Runtime
Context/Goal: Investigate and resolve Windows CI timeout mapping (Issue #5). Ensure TIMEOUT (rc=124) is returned for wall-time violations on Windows GHA and re-enable the test.
Actions:
- Analyzed exec/sandbox.py timeout handling and normalization paths; identified Windows fall-through to INTERNAL_ERROR when TimeoutExpired is not raised.
- Added deterministic fallback in run_pytests_v2 to set timed_out=True if duration_ms >= wall_time_s*1000.
- Re-enabled the test in .github/workflows/ci.yml (removed -k exclusion on Windows job).
- Posted analysis and plan as a comment to Issue #5 with code references and artifact details.
Results:
- Local validation deferred (no dependency installs without approval). Expect TIMEOUT mapping to be stable on Windows CI after change.
Diagnostics:
- On Windows GHA, TimeoutExpired may sporadically not raise; mapping then fell through to INTERNAL_ERROR. Fallback uses measured wall time to assert timeout deterministically.
Decision(s): Apply minimal, platform-agnostic fallback; keep diagnostics env-guarded.
Follow-ups:
- Push branch and open/refresh PR; validate Windows CI; confirm diagnostics show timed_out=true and rc=124; maintain ≥85% coverage.

## Detailed Log

### 2025-10-20 00:00–00:30 — Implementation Plan and Research Indexes

- Context
  - Created `Docs/ImplementationPlan.md` aligned to Blueprint and rules; Phases 1–2 fully mapped; later phases outlined.
  - Added P0 notes under `P0/notes/`:
    - `blueprint_index.md`: section anchors and acceptance criteria snapshots from Blueprint.
    - `vesper_capability_matrix.md`: hybrid search, fusion, filters, index manager, planner, IO; gaps/risks documented.
    - `implementation_alignment_report.md`: mapping decisions and minimal binding surface.

- Validation
  - Cross-referenced Vesper sources: `search/hybrid_searcher.{hpp,cpp}`, `search/fusion_algorithms.cpp`, `metadata/metadata_store.hpp`, `index/index_manager.cpp`, `index/query_planner.cpp`.

### 2025-10-20 01:00–01:10 — Task 1 Completed: Extract HybridSearch surface

- Added `P1/notes/hybrid_search_surface.md` summarizing binding types (PyHybridQuery/Config/Result), functions (engine_init/open/upsert/search_hybrid), strategies/fusions, filters conversion, determinism details, and acceptance checks.
- This feeds Tasks 3–7 for pybind11 type mapping, module functions, and CMake wiring.

---

## Results
- Plan established; research grounded in concrete Vesper code paths; initial scaffolding present.
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1 Batch 1.1 (bindings) and 1.2 (ContextStore wiring) under deterministic settings.

---

## Decisions
- Expose hybrid search configuration knobs (strategy, fusion, rerank) directly via bindings for transparency and tuning.
- Filters accepted as simple KV or JSON; convert to `filter_expr` via Vesper utils in bindings layer.
- Defer snapshots/rollback and three-way merge to Phase 3; keep early phases simple and deterministic.

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize binding signatures and compile; create import/test wheel on Windows host.
- Implement ContextStore.search/add_document; create tiny synthetic dataset for smoke test.
- Add micro-bench for hybrid search and upsert; capture P50/P95 baselines.

---

### 2025-10-20 02:10–02:25 — Task 6 Completed: module.cpp bindings

- Created `bindings/python/pyvesper/module.cpp` exposing enums (`QueryStrategy`, `FusionAlgorithm`), types (`HybridSearchConfig`, `HybridResult`, `HybridQuery`), and `Engine` methods (`initialize`, `open_collection`, `upsert`, `search_hybrid`, determinism toggles).
- Added numpy-friendly embedding marshaling (accepts 1D `np.float32` arrays or `List[float]`) and strict filter handling (dict or JSON string) with clear `ValueError` on misuse.
- Included comprehensive docstrings; documented deterministic behavior and config usage.
- Updated `Docs/TASKS.md` Task 6 to Completed.

---

### 2025-10-20 03:05–03:40 — AgentResult → Context writes integration

- Context
  - Extended agent handlers to return `AgentResult` payloads with `payload.delta.doc` for code artifacts.
  - Implemented `Orchestrator.apply_agent_result` to map `delta.doc` → `CodeDocument` and call `ContextStore.add_code_documents`.
  - Added `Orchestrator.set_context_store` for dependency injection.

- Validation
  - New unit test `tests/unit/context_integration_test.py` asserts that applying an `AgentResult` triggers `add_code_documents` with expected fields.
  - Adjusted `ContextStore` to lazily import the Vesper backend to avoid importing `pyvesper` in unit test collection.

- Results
  - Python unit tests pass via CTest (`ctest -R python_unit_tests`).
  - Lints clean on touched Python files.

- Next
  - Extend mapping to support text/test documents (`TextDocument`, `TestResultDocument`).
  - Route `TestAgent` artifacts into `TestResultDocument` and persist via `add_text_documents` or a dedicated helper.
  - Add failure-path tests (invalid payload shapes → validator errors) and CLI examples reflecting queue/metrics.

---

### 2025-10-21 09:00–10:30 — Redaction hooks, structured docs, and param tests

- Context
  - Added `orchestrator/obs/redaction.py` with pattern-based redaction (`sanitize_text`) and env-driven field-based hooks (`sanitize_artifact`).
  - Extended orchestrator to redact `test_result.log` and `analysis.details` and apply field-level hooks per artifact kind.
  - Introduced structured context docs: `DiffSummaryDocument`, `CoverageHintDocument`, with `ContextStore.add_diff_summaries`/`add_coverage_hints`.

- Validation
  - Parameterized tests for diff summaries and coverage hints; multi-artifact flows; invalid severities/suggestions; redaction of emails/tokens in details; log redaction.
  - All Python tests pass under CTest.

- Next
  - CLI flags to set redaction prefixes/fields; display effective config in `status`.
  - Benchmarks/SLOs for redaction throughput/latency; CI guards.
  - Docs: add redaction policy and usage examples.

Date (UTC): 2025-10-26 19:28
Area: CI|Diagnostics
Context/Goal: Unable to fetch artifact bytes via API tool to parse diagnostics JSONL. Emit CI diagnostics to stdout to unblock analysis on Windows CI logs.
Actions:
- Modified exec/sandbox.py:_ci_diag_write to also print completed/exception events to stdout when VLTAIR_CI_DIAG=1 and GITHUB_ACTIONS=true.
- Will re-run CI and scrape [ci-diag] lines from Windows job logs to capture returncode/timed_out/status/rc_mapped/reason/duration_ms.
Results:
- Expect logs to contain a single-line JSON for event=completed.
Diagnostics:
- This is a no-op for local runs; file write remains primary output; printing only when env-guarded.
Decision(s): Keep change minimal; no behavior change except emitting diag line for observability.
Follow-ups:
- Push to debug/ci-windows-timeout-diagnostics; monitor run; if timed_out remains false, use evidence to adjust timeout handling minimally.

Date (UTC): 2025-10-26 21:20
Area: Architecture|Runtime
Context/Goal: Implement P2-2.1 (Agent interfaces and registry) per Phase 2 requirements with minimal, deterministic changes.
Actions:
- Research: Reviewed Docs/ImplementationPlan.md Phase 2, Blueprint message schemas, multi-agent-coordination rules, and existing code under orchestrator/agents and orchestrator/core/registry.
- Design: Kept existing structure; added explicit ABC base with abstract run() and deterministic contract docstring.
- Impl:
  - orchestrator/agents/base.py → converted Agent to ABC with @abstractmethod run(); added AgentContext Protocol docstring.
  - orchestrator/core/registry.py → added duplicate registration validation (raises ValueError); added class/method docstrings.
- Tests: Added tests/unit/agents_test.py covering abstract enforcement, simple agent subclass run, duplicate registration error, and registry isolation.
Results:
- Local env lacks pytest; deferred execution to CI. Changes are minimal and should not affect existing behavior except to reject duplicate registrations (no callers rely on duplicate overwrite).
Diagnostics:
- The repo already had a functioning Agent base and a routing registry; P2-2.1 completion focused on hardening (docs, abstractness, validation) rather than structural changes to avoid churn.
Decisions:
- Preserve registry surface and Orchestrator dispatch; avoid introducing class-mapping registry at this stage. Enforce duplicate rejection for safety.
Follow-ups:
- P2-2.2 CodeGenAgent specifics; consider adding optional factory mapping in registry in a future batch if needed by orchestration design.


Date (UTC): 2025-10-26 20:00
Area: CI|Runtime
Context/Goal: After restoring exec/sandbox.py, Windows CI still fails on test_integration_timeout_enforced with INTERNAL_ERROR. Diagnose via CI artifact and fix minimal root cause.
Actions:
- Used gh to list/view latest run for branch (run 18822955767) and downloaded ci-diagnostics-windows artifact.
- Parsed run_pytests_v2_windows.jsonl; for the timeout test invocation, observed returncode=2, timed_out=false, status="INTERNAL_ERROR", rc_mapped=1, duration_ms=650.
- Command in diag shows pytest invoked on C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\... while runner cwd is D:\a\VLAIR\VLAIR.
- Identified Windows cross-drive issue: pytest collection errors with "path is on mount 'C:', start on mount 'D:'" when test path is on a different drive from cwd.
- Implemented minimal fix: in run_pytests_v2, detect cross-drive case on Windows and set cwd for subprocess.Popen to the test file's directory (same drive) when all paths share a different drive; pass cwd=cwd_run.
Results:
- SyntaxError resolved; Python tests execute; coverage remains ≥85%.
Diagnostics:
- JSONL completed event (traceId=7ee22a7536a64086a784288751b43adf): returncode=2, timed_out=false, status=INTERNAL_ERROR, reason="exit code 2", duration_ms=650; stdout header shows collected 1 item / 1 error (collection error), consistent with cross-drive root cause.
Decision(s): Adjust working directory only on Windows and only when all test paths are on a different drive letter than current cwd; no other behavior changes.
Follow-ups:
- Push change; monitor next Windows CI run; expect the test to now execute and hit wall-time timeout, mapping to TIMEOUT/124.
