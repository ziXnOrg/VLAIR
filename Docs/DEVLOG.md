Context/Goal: Strengthen Windows timeout mapping to force rc=124 whenever timeout is detected by duration fallback (Issue #5); re-run CI to validate.
Actions:
- Updated exec/sandbox.py to compute rc_raw = 124 if timed_out else (p.returncode if p.returncode is not None else 1).
- Intention: eliminate ambiguity where Windows sets a non-zero exit code post-limit even when timed_out=True via duration.
Results:
- CI run pending at the time of this entry; prior run failed on Windows with INTERNAL_ERROR despite duration fallback.
Diagnostics:
- Hypothesis: previous logic used p.returncode when present, causing normalization to INTERNAL_ERROR on Windows.
Decision(s): Force rc=124 when timed_out=True to guarantee TIMEOUT mapping.
Follow-ups:
- Monitor Windows CI; extract diagnostics JSONL showing timed_out=true, status="TIMEOUT", rc_mapped=124, reason="wall timeout", duration_ms≈1000–1200; post to Issue #5.

Area: CI|Runtime
Context/Goal: Investigate and resolve Windows CI timeout mapping (Issue #5). Ensure TIMEOUT (rc=124) is returned for wall-time violations on Windows GHA and re-enable the test.
Actions:
- Analyzed exec/sandbox.py timeout handling and normalization paths; identified Windows fall-through to INTERNAL_ERROR when TimeoutExpired is not raised.
- Added deterministic fallback in run_pytests_v2 to set timed_out=True if duration_ms >= wall_time_s*1000.
- Re-enabled the test in .github/workflows/ci.yml (removed -k exclusion on Windows job).
- Posted analysis and plan as a comment to Issue #5 with code references and artifact details.
Results:
- Local validation deferred (no dependency installs without approval). Expect TIMEOUT mapping to be stable on Windows CI after change.
Diagnostics:
- On Windows GHA, TimeoutExpired may sporadically not raise; mapping then fell through to INTERNAL_ERROR. Fallback uses measured wall time to assert timeout deterministically.
Decision(s): Apply minimal, platform-agnostic fallback; keep diagnostics env-guarded.
Follow-ups:
- Push branch and open/refresh PR; validate Windows CI; confirm diagnostics show timed_out=true and rc=124; maintain ≥85% coverage.

## Summary
- ImplementationPlan.md created and expanded with P0 research findings (hybrid search API/strategy/fusion, metadata filters, planner surfaces, determinism implications).
- Phase 0 notes added: blueprint_index.md, vesper_capability_matrix.md, implementation_alignment_report.md.
- Phase 1 scaffolding directories and initial schema/interface stubs committed.
- Next: finalize pybind11 binding surface and wire VesperContextStore to bindings; add unit/integration tests and micro-bench baselines.

## Detailed Log

### 2025-10-20 00:00–00:30 — Implementation Plan and Research Indexes

- Context
  - Created `Docs/ImplementationPlan.md` aligned to Blueprint and rules; Phases 1–2 fully mapped; later phases outlined.
  - Added P0 notes under `P0/notes/`:
    - `blueprint_index.md`: section anchors and acceptance criteria snapshots from Blueprint.
    - `vesper_capability_matrix.md`: hybrid search, fusion, filters, index manager, planner, IO; gaps/risks documented.
    - `implementation_alignment_report.md`: mapping decisions and minimal binding surface.

- Validation
  - Cross-referenced Vesper sources: `search/hybrid_searcher.{hpp,cpp}`, `search/fusion_algorithms.cpp`, `metadata/metadata_store.hpp`, `index/index_manager.cpp`, `index/query_planner.cpp`.

### 2025-10-20 01:00–01:10 — Task 1 Completed: Extract HybridSearch surface

- Added `P1/notes/hybrid_search_surface.md` summarizing binding types (PyHybridQuery/Config/Result), functions (engine_init/open/upsert/search_hybrid), strategies/fusions, filters conversion, determinism details, and acceptance checks.
- This feeds Tasks 3–7 for pybind11 type mapping, module functions, and CMake wiring.

---

## Results
- Plan established; research grounded in concrete Vesper code paths; initial scaffolding present.
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1 Batch 1.1 (bindings) and 1.2 (ContextStore wiring) under deterministic settings.

---

## Decisions
- Expose hybrid search configuration knobs (strategy, fusion, rerank) directly via bindings for transparency and tuning.
- Filters accepted as simple KV or JSON; convert to `filter_expr` via Vesper utils in bindings layer.
- Defer snapshots/rollback and three-way merge to Phase 3; keep early phases simple and deterministic.

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize binding signatures and compile; create import/test wheel on Windows host.
- Implement ContextStore.search/add_document; create tiny synthetic dataset for smoke test.
- Add micro-bench for hybrid search and upsert; capture P50/P95 baselines.

---

### 2025-10-20 02:10–02:25 — Task 6 Completed: module.cpp bindings

- Created `bindings/python/pyvesper/module.cpp` exposing enums (`QueryStrategy`, `FusionAlgorithm`), types (`HybridSearchConfig`, `HybridResult`, `HybridQuery`), and `Engine` methods (`initialize`, `open_collection`, `upsert`, `search_hybrid`, determinism toggles).
- Added numpy-friendly embedding marshaling (accepts 1D `np.float32` arrays or `List[float]`) and strict filter handling (dict or JSON string) with clear `ValueError` on misuse.
- Included comprehensive docstrings; documented deterministic behavior and config usage.
- Updated `Docs/TASKS.md` Task 6 to Completed.

---

### 2025-10-20 03:05–03:40 — AgentResult → Context writes integration

- Context
  - Extended agent handlers to return `AgentResult` payloads with `payload.delta.doc` for code artifacts.
  - Implemented `Orchestrator.apply_agent_result` to map `delta.doc` → `CodeDocument` and call `ContextStore.add_code_documents`.
  - Added `Orchestrator.set_context_store` for dependency injection.

- Validation
  - New unit test `tests/unit/context_integration_test.py` asserts that applying an `AgentResult` triggers `add_code_documents` with expected fields.
  - Adjusted `ContextStore` to lazily import the Vesper backend to avoid importing `pyvesper` in unit test collection.

- Results
  - Python unit tests pass via CTest (`ctest -R python_unit_tests`).
  - Lints clean on touched Python files.

- Next
  - Extend mapping to support text/test documents (`TextDocument`, `TestResultDocument`).
  - Route `TestAgent` artifacts into `TestResultDocument` and persist via `add_text_documents` or a dedicated helper.
  - Add failure-path tests (invalid payload shapes → validator errors) and CLI examples reflecting queue/metrics.

---

### 2025-10-21 09:00–10:30 — Redaction hooks, structured docs, and param tests

- Context
  - Added `orchestrator/obs/redaction.py` with pattern-based redaction (`sanitize_text`) and env-driven field-based hooks (`sanitize_artifact`).
  - Extended orchestrator to redact `test_result.log` and `analysis.details` and apply field-level hooks per artifact kind.
  - Introduced structured context docs: `DiffSummaryDocument`, `CoverageHintDocument`, with `ContextStore.add_diff_summaries`/`add_coverage_hints`.

- Validation
  - Parameterized tests for diff summaries and coverage hints; multi-artifact flows; invalid severities/suggestions; redaction of emails/tokens in details; log redaction.
  - All Python tests pass under CTest.

- Next
  - CLI flags to set redaction prefixes/fields; display effective config in `status`.
  - Benchmarks/SLOs for redaction throughput/latency; CI guards.
  - Docs: add redaction policy and usage examples.
